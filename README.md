# Solutions of ODE tasks

## About

There are 6 tasks proposed by proffesor of Sevastopol branch of MSU George Osipenko within the course "Ordinary Differential Equations".

First two of them are related to numerical analysis of differentail equations. Other tasks are part of symbolic image of dynamical systems area. You can find more information about this in the book stored in my repository.

## Code

I used C/C++ library "graphics.h" to solve this problems. 

Unfortunately, I forgot how to install it on Windows, but you can easily find useful tutorials in YouTube. 

To install library in Ubuntu you can use [this](https://gist.github.com/sidvishnoi/726105762244586ec3be4c1882461703) script.
